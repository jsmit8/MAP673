# Lab 07: Carto.js and MAP673 Final Map Planning

## Part I. Using Carto.js

Using your own dataset hosted by CARTO, build a client-side thematic web map using the Carto.js `createLayer()` method, and a source object. The map type may be of any kind (choropleth, prop symbol, etc). And you may symbolize it as you wish.

Be sure to minimally include:

* a map title and description (I recommend creating a div element and positioning it absolutely over the map, and structuring your header, paragraph and/or list items within that div)
* any relevant metadata
* **challenge:** a meaningful legend (the lesson doesn't cover this, but search CARTO's docs and consider how to include a legend in your map)

### Extra challenges:

**Extra challenge option #1**: Extend what is covered in the lesson to include an interactive info window to retrieve specific information about map features. Consult the CARTO guide [Creating an info window with the createLayer() function](http://docs.cartodb.com/faqs/infowindows/#creating-an-infowindow-with-the-createlayer-function).

##Part II. Final Project Proposal

Submit a 1-2 page written project proposal (format of your choice) including:

**from lab 07**
* description of data topic (with an anticipated map title)
* map objectives
* user needs, articulated through a persona/scenario
* data sources

**new this week**
* identification of anticipated thematic representation (e.g., dot map, choropleth, prop symbols, etc)
* a content and requirements list (see Module 05)
* description of the anticipated user interaction (UI)
* a series of low fidelity wireframes, paper prototypes, or mockups (in addition to the 1-2 pages)
